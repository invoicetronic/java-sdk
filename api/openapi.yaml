    The [Invoicetronic API][2] is a RESTful service that allows you to send and receive invoices through the Italian [Servizio di Interscambio (SDI)][1], or Interchange Service. The API is designed to be simple and easy to use, abstracting away SDI complexity while providing complete control over the invoice send/receive process. It provides advanced features as encryption at rest, multi-language pre-flight invoice validation, multiple upload formats, webhooks, event logging, client SDKs, and CLI tools.

    For more information, see  [Invoicetronic website][2]

        Delete a company by its internal id.

        **Companies** are the entities that send and receive invoices. They are automatically created from invoice data when invoices are sent or received.

        **Warning:** Deleting a company will permanently remove all associated data, including sent invoices, received invoices, invoice updates from SDI, logs, and webhooks.

        If the company has any linked invoices, you must explicitly confirm deletion by adding `?force=true` to the request. Without this parameter, the API will return `409 Conflict` with details about the linked data.

      description: |-
        Export invoices as a ZIP archive of FatturaPA XML files, suitable for import into accounting software (TeamSystem, Zucchetti, etc.).

        **Sent invoices** are only included when they have reached a definitive state (e.g., `Consegnato` for private recipients, `AccettatoDalDestinatario`, `DecorrenzaTermini`, etc.). Invoices still being processed by SDI are excluded.

        **Received invoices** are always included. Unread invoices are automatically marked as read and counted as operations.

        ### Period filters

        You can filter by period using either:
        - `year` + `month` (e.g., `year=2026&month=3` for March 2026)
        - `year` + `quarter` (e.g., `year=2026&quarter=1` for Q1 Jan-Mar)
        - `document_date_from` / `document_date_to` for a custom date range

        These options are mutually exclusive. The `year` parameter alone is not valid and requires either `month` or `quarter`.

        ### Response

        Returns `200` with a ZIP archive, or `204 No Content` if no invoices match the given filters. Files in the archive are organized by company VAT number (`{vat}/send/`, `{vat}/receive/`).

        ### Rate limiting

        This endpoint has a dedicated rate limit: only one export request per user can be processed at a time. Concurrent requests will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

        Retrieve an update by its internal id.

        **Updates** are status notifications from Italy's SDI (Sistema di Interscambio) about invoices you sent. Multiple updates can exist for the same send item as the invoice progresses through the SDI workflow.

        The `state` field is the most important property and can have the following values:

        | Value | Name | Description |
        |-------|------|-------------|
        | 2 | `Inviato` | Sent to the SDI. |
        | 5 | `Consegnato` | Delivered to the recipient. |
        | 6 | `NonConsegnato` | Not delivered to the recipient. Only relevant for public administration entities. |
        | 7 | `Scartato` | Rejected by the SDI. |
        | 8 | `AccettatoDalDestinatario` | Accepted by the recipient. Only relevant for public administration entities. |
        | 9 | `RifiutatoDalDestinatario` | Rejected by the recipient. Only relevant for public administration entities. |
        | 10 | `ImpossibilitaDiRecapito` | Available on the recipient's tax drawer, but it was not possible to deliver it to the recipient's reception system. |
        | 11 | `DecorrenzaTermini` | A public administration entity has not responded for more than 15 days. The document is considered delivered. |
        | 12 | `AttestazioneTrasmissioneFattura` | A public administration entity has received the document, but has not yet processed it. |

        **Important:** Always monitor the state of your sent invoices. A state of `Inviato` only means the invoice has been submitted to SDI, not that it has been delivered. A state like `Scartato` indicates that the invoice was **not** successfully delivered and may require corrective action, such as fixing validation errors and resubmitting. In that case, `description` contains the reason for the rejection.

        | 7 | `Scartato` | Rejected by the SDI. |
        | 8 | `AccettatoDalDestinatario` | Accepted by the recipient. Only relevant for public administration entities. |
        | 9 | `RifiutatoDalDestinatario` | Rejected by the recipient. Only relevant for public administration entities. |
        | 10 | `ImpossibilitaDiRecapito` | Available on the recipient's tax drawer, but it was not possible to deliver it to the recipient's reception system. |
        | 11 | `DecorrenzaTermini` | A public administration entity has not responded for more than 15 days. The document is considered delivered. |
        | 12 | `AttestazioneTrasmissioneFattura` | A public administration entity has received the document, but has not yet processed it. |

        **Important:** Always monitor the state of your sent invoices. A state of `Inviato` only means the invoice has been submitted to SDI, not that it has been delivered. A state like `Scartato` indicates that the invoice was **not** successfully delivered and may require corrective action, such as fixing validation errors and resubmitting. In that case, `description` contains the reason for the rejection.
