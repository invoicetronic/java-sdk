/*
 * Invoicetronic API
 * The [Invoicetronic API][2] is a RESTful service that allows you to send and receive invoices through the Italian [Servizio di Interscambio (SDI)][1], or Interchange Service. The API is designed to be simple and easy to use, abstracting away SDI complexity while providing complete control over the invoice send/receive process. It provides advanced features as encryption at rest, multi-language pre-flight invoice validation, multiple upload formats, webhooks, event logging, client SDKs, and CLI tools.  For more information, see  [Invoicetronic website][2]  [1]: https://www.fatturapa.gov.it/it/sistemainterscambio/cose-il-sdi/ [2]: https://invoicetronic.com/

     * Export invoices as a ZIP archive
     *
     * Export invoices as a ZIP archive of FatturaPA XML files, suitable for import into accounting software (TeamSystem, Zucchetti, etc.).  **Sent invoices** are only included when they have reached a definitive state (e.g., &#x60;Consegnato&#x60; for private recipients, &#x60;AccettatoDalDestinatario&#x60;, &#x60;DecorrenzaTermini&#x60;, etc.). Invoices still being processed by SDI are excluded.  **Received invoices** are always included. Unread invoices are automatically marked as read and counted as operations.  ### Period filters  You can filter by period using either: - &#x60;year&#x60; + &#x60;month&#x60; (e.g., &#x60;year&#x3D;2026&amp;month&#x3D;3&#x60; for March 2026) - &#x60;year&#x60; + &#x60;quarter&#x60; (e.g., &#x60;year&#x3D;2026&amp;quarter&#x3D;1&#x60; for Q1 Jan-Mar) - &#x60;document_date_from&#x60; / &#x60;document_date_to&#x60; for a custom date range  These options are mutually exclusive. The &#x60;year&#x60; parameter alone is not valid and requires either &#x60;month&#x60; or &#x60;quarter&#x60;.  ### Response  Returns &#x60;200&#x60; with a ZIP archive, or &#x60;204 No Content&#x60; if no invoices match the given filters. Files in the archive are organized by company VAT number (&#x60;{vat}/send/&#x60;, &#x60;{vat}/receive/&#x60;).  ### Rate limiting  This endpoint has a dedicated rate limit: only one export request per user can be processed at a time. Concurrent requests will receive a &#x60;429 Too Many Requests&#x60; response.
