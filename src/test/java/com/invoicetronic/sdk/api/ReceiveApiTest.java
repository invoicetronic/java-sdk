/*
 * Invoicetronic API
 * The [Invoicetronic API][2] is a RESTful service that allows you to send and receive invoices through the Italian [Servizio di Interscambio (SDI)][1], or Interchange Service. The API is designed to be simple and easy to use, abstracting away SDI complexity while providing complete control over the invoice send/receive process. It provides advanced features as encryption at rest, multi-language pre-flight invoice validation, multiple upload formats, webhooks, event logging, client SDKs, and CLI tools.  For more information, see  [Invoicetronic website][2]  [1]: https://www.fatturapa.gov.it/it/sistemainterscambio/cose-il-sdi/ [2]: https://invoicetronic.com/
