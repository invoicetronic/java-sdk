/*
 * Invoicetronic API
 * The [Invoicetronic API][2] is a RESTful service that allows you to send and receive invoices through the Italian [Servizio di Interscambio (SDI)][1], or Interchange Service. The API is designed to be simple and easy to use, abstracting away SDI complexity while providing complete control over the invoice send/receive process. It provides advanced features as encryption at rest, multi-language pre-flight invoice validation, multiple upload formats, webhooks, event logging, client SDKs, and CLI tools.  For more information, see  [Invoicetronic website][2]  [1]: https://www.fatturapa.gov.it/it/sistemainterscambio/cose-il-sdi/ [2]: https://invoicetronic.com/

     * This endpoint is used to know how many operations (invoices + validations) and signatures are left on your account.   When &#x60;signature_left&#x60; is 0, you will receive a &#x60;403 Forbidden&#x60; response if you try to sign an invoice. Likewise, if &#x60;operation_left&#x60; is 0, you will receive a &#x60;403 Forbidden&#x60; response when storing or validating an invoice.  You can raise the limits by purchasing operations and/or signatures from the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.invoicetronic.com).  __Please note__ that these values are not enforced if you are on the Sandbox. See the [API Keys &amp; Sandbox](https://invoicetronic.com/apikeys/) documentation section to learn more about the Sandbox.
