/*
 * Invoicetronic API
 * The [Invoicetronic API][2] is a RESTful service that allows you to send and receive invoices through the Italian [Servizio di Interscambio (SDI)][1], or Interchange Service. The API is designed to be simple and easy to use, abstracting away SDI complexity while providing complete control over the invoice send/receive process. It provides advanced features as encryption at rest, multi-language pre-flight invoice validation, multiple upload formats, webhooks, event logging, client SDKs, and CLI tools.  For more information, see  [Invoicetronic website][2]  [1]: https://www.fatturapa.gov.it/it/sistemainterscambio/cose-il-sdi/ [2]: https://invoicetronic.com/

     * List updates

     * Retrieve a paginated list of updates. Results can be filtered by various criteria such as company, send item, SDI state, and date ranges.  **Updates** are status notifications from Italy&#39;s SDI (Sistema di Interscambio) about invoices you sent. Multiple updates can exist for the same send item as the invoice progresses through the SDI workflow.  The &#x60;state&#x60; field is the most important property and can have the following values:  | Value | Name | Description | |-------|------|-------------| | 2 | &#x60;Inviato&#x60; | Sent to the SDI. | | 5 | &#x60;Consegnato&#x60; | Delivered to the recipient. | | 6 | &#x60;NonConsegnato&#x60; | Not delivered to the recipient. Only relevant for public administration entities. | | 7 | &#x60;Scartato&#x60; | Rejected by the SDI. | | 8 | &#x60;AccettatoDalDestinatario&#x60; | Accepted by the recipient. Only relevant for public administration entities. | | 9 | &#x60;RifiutatoDalDestinatario&#x60; | Rejected by the recipient. Only relevant for public administration entities. | | 10 | &#x60;ImpossibilitaDiRecapito&#x60; | Available on the recipient&#39;s tax drawer, but it was not possible to deliver it to the recipient&#39;s reception system. | | 11 | &#x60;DecorrenzaTermini&#x60; | A public administration entity has not responded for more than 15 days. The document is considered delivered. | | 12 | &#x60;AttestazioneTrasmissioneFattura&#x60; | A public administration entity has received the document, but has not yet processed it. |  **Important:** Always monitor the state of your sent invoices. A state of &#x60;Inviato&#x60; only means the invoice has been submitted to SDI, not that it has been delivered. A state like &#x60;Scartato&#x60; indicates that the invoice was **not** successfully delivered and may require corrective action, such as fixing validation errors and resubmitting. In that case, &#x60;description&#x60; contains the reason for the rejection.
